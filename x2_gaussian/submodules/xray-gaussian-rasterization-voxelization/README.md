# Differentiable X-ray Gaussian Rasterization and Voxelization

Used as the rasterization and voxelization engine for the paper "R$^2$-Gaussian: Rectifying Radiative Gaussian Splatting for Tomographic Reconstruction". The repository is adapted from [diff-gaussian-rasterization](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/diff-gaussian-rasterization). Note that we still use symbol `opacity` to represent `density` in our paper.
